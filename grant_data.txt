For me, sure. Before 5:00 it must end, as we have scream park this weekend for fundraising. I'll fish the idea out to various interested designers at the upcoming internship. (cough cough other designers people interested RESPOND HERE)
Not extremely quick, we need to have a designer meeting on upcoming goals. I would presume before around the 13th tho, since we should have a plan for what we're doing by then. I really want to be able to use the same bushings for inner and outer arms (either single post or double post), so making those bushings early into the process isn't bad
meet with how? in person? quick google meet? It'd have to be after 4:30ish, we have Short Circuits. (if its internship)
I'm leaning towards Oracle because only java-free and its still a Nish-type joke
yeaaa, we might need to use you for some 5 axis here soon... i don't see us being able to do the bushing blocks easily, and we already saw them break on TShirt
Its only buttery since we actually have covers which let us have the red tacky like... continue to exist after 5 minutes
i have  noticed some things on that tho... seems that as voltage drops, the performance of the mac mini goes down what seems exponentially. At around PDH 11.8, i started to get around 35-40 fps on apriltag, 30 on obj. We're still going to need a buck converter I think, sadly
also 15W was my measured wattage :)
(working on getting that 55 to 60 rn)
60 fps apriltag detection across 4 cams tested all apriltags, 1604x1300, color. 55 fps apriltag detection across 4 cams AND OBJ running (bumpers detection) on one cam, 45 FPS. 1604x1300, color. Those are the tested... I've not hit a wall really yet.
currently making it run even faster lol... moar fps
got moar fps to work :)
because the new students were put in a corner and told to build it
whaaaaat noooooooo

I tried to use 1/4 and 1/8 all the way for plating, I was simply unable to in my designs. It really sucked, but since we have the 1/4 already we can at least kill 66.76*2 dollars off the cost
what would freshman me do if he saw it...
Southmoon's various bits and pieces are all running, and connected up! All cameras can have variable exposure/camera controls, custom object detection modules (who wants to give me 500 pictures of themselves?), and everything in between.
Todos aren't THAT many:
Calibrate all four cameras, properly, with proper camera settings (exposure, white balance, etc)
Confirm single tag estimates work for all cameras, not just the few that have already been tested, and are similar to each other (hoping for BETWEEN CAMERA error to be around 0.03-0.05m.)
Confirm multi-tag estimates work for all cameras, and are similar to each other.
See what sorta crazy pathing/detection/avoidance we can pull off with the level of accuracy we have lol.
Remaining wiring todo
(Just to remember)
